### Project Context:

FamilyGrocer Inc. – Global Expansion Under Regulatory Scrutiny
FamilyGrocer Inc. is a publicly traded global grocery chain (100 countries) facing critical IT risks during an aggressive expansion phase (new stores, digital commerce, pharmacy M&A). Legacy issues, including a high-profile data breach, executive turnover, and severe External Auditor concerns regarding access controls and lack of vendor governance, necessitate immediate strategic action.

This growth is severely complicated by critical legacy issues and significant IT risks, primarily:

<br />

The Board of Directors has mandated an urgent review to assess and elevate the maturity of the IT Risk Management (IT RM) and IT Operations organizations to effectively support the accelerated global expansion.
<br />
<br />
### Project Objectives (My Role):
The primary objective of this project was to develop an executive-level proposal, mandated by the Board, outlining the necessary capabilities and processes to mature FamilyGrocer’s IT Risk Management organization.

IT Risk Identification & Analysis: Identify and prioritize the most critical IT risks that could adversely impact the business's triple expansion strategy (new stores, digital growth, M&A).

Maturity Gap Assessment: Define the necessary capabilities and maturity level required for the IT RM organization to move from its current reactive state to a proactive strategic enabler.

Governance Roadmap Proposal: Formulate strategic recommendations and an implementation road map detailing the actions, activities, and projects needed to achieve the required IT RM maturity.

COBIT Alignment: Map current organizational strengths and weaknesses to COBIT Enabling Processes to provide a clear, standardized view of governance priorities to the Board.

Advise the Board on the full IT outsourcing decision and analyze its comprehensive impact on IT Risk Management and Cybersecurity capabilities.

Identify and provide actionable recommendations on the three most critical IT-related regulations, and recommend a strategy to reinforce deficient IT Internal Controls in Latin America.

Determine the necessary actions to complete the stalled SAP implementation (Asia/Latin America), resolve the conflicting CRM strategy (SAP vs. Salesforce), and address a major vendor license compliance audit demand.

Analyze and provide recommendations on the risk associated with all new innovation and expansion initiatives (M&A integration, Drones, IoT, Analytics) to ensure risk is governed strategically.

<h2>Tools and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Interviews, Google Docs, MS Excel, Miro, MS Project, COBIT 2019 Framework, NIST CSF, ISO 27001, MS Powerpoint</b> 

<h2>Engagement Approach: Navigating Strategic Transformation</h2>
<b>A rapid, risk-centric consulting approach designed to validate C-Suite concerns and quickly establish a prioritized transformation roadmap.
</b>
- The engagement began with intensive, structured interviews with the CEO, CFO, CIO, and other executives. Using a structured interview guide tailored to the stated operational and strategic questions, we gathered context on risk appetite, technology pain points, and expansion goals. This phase quickly isolated Vendor Management and Access Controls as the most immediate, high-impact risks requiring remediation.<br />
- We utilized GRC methodologies (COBIT 2019) to assess the current maturity and map existing deficiencies against required capabilities. This allowed us to objectively determine if the IT function could support the rapid expansion and M&A.<br />
- Based on validated risks and C-Suite input, we developed a comprehensive Transformation Roadmap. This roadmap provided the strategic conclusion on the outsourcing question while simultaneously outlining phased projects to address critical operational failures (SAP remediation, CRM conflict resolution, regulatory compliance).<br />
- The final deliverables—the Transformation Report and the Executive Presentation—were synthesized to be decisive and concise, focusing only on the high-level recommendations and quantifiable risks necessary for Board-level decision-making.<br />

This phased approach ensured that all recommendations were aligned with business objectives and supported by concrete analysis of the existing control environment, providing maximum value in a short timeframe.
